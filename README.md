We would be making an Audio to Sign Language Translator application. 

Initial decisions to be taken -

Which sign language to be used ? 
  -American Sign Language (ASL)
  -British  Sign Language (BSL)
  -Indian Sign Language (ISL)
  
What would be the application type ?
   -Dekstop application
   -Mobile application
   -Web application
   
Methodology to be followed-
1. Audio Input
2. Conversion of Audio input to text
3. Coversion of English language text to sign language text depending on the grammatical rules of the sign language chosen. 
4. Generation of sign language using animation or fetching up videos from some predfined dataset and playing them. 

To be discussed-
1. Which all technologies will be used for implementing each of the steps
2. Related study resources
3. Datasets required
